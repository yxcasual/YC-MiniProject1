                the Andromeda Galaxy contains approximately one trillion stars,[10] more than twice the number of the
                Milky Way’s estimated 200-400 billion stars. The Andromeda Galaxy, spanning approximately 220,000
                light years, is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy
                and other minor galaxies. Its mass is estimated to be ~0.8-1.5×1012 solar masses, whereas the Milky
                Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5×1011 solar masses.</p>
