                <h1 class="display-3">The Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
                <p>The Andromeda Galaxy also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780
                    kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.
                    Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda.</p>

                    <h2>Observation History</h2>
                    <p>Around the year 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy,
                        in his Book of Fixed Stars as a "nebulous smear". Star charts of that period labeled it as the Little Cloud.
                        In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on
                        telescopic observations. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant in 1755 in his work Universal Natural
                        History and Theory of the Heavens conjectured that the blurry spot was an island universe. In 1764,
                        Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer
                        despite it being visible to the naked eye. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint
                        reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the
                        "great nebulae", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that
                        it is no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius. In 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse,
                        saw and made the first drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure. </p>

                    <h2>Collision with milky way</h2>
                    <p> The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 110 kilometres per second (68 mi/s).
                        It has been measured approaching relative to our Sun at around 300 kilometres per second (190 mi/s)
                        as the Sun orbits around the center of our galaxy at a speed of approximately 225 kilometres per
                        second (140 mi/s). This makes the Andromeda Galaxy one of about 100 observable blueshifted galaxies.
                        Andromeda Galaxy's tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the Milky Way is relatively much
                        smaller than the approaching velocity and therefore it is expected to collide directly with the Milky
                        Way in about 4 billion years. A likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to
                        form a giant elliptical galaxy[97] or perhaps even a large disc galaxy.Such events are frequent among
                        the galaxies in galaxy groups. The fate of the Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision
                        is currently unknown. Before the galaxies merge, there is a small chance that the Solar System could be
                        ejected from the Milky Way or join the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>

                    <h2>Interactions</h2>
                    <p>New images from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shed light on the Andromeda Galaxy's violent past.
                        The images show that one of the latter's satellite galaxies, M32, blasted through one of the Andromeda
                        Galaxy's spiral arms a few million years ago. Infrared pictures of the galaxy's two spiral arms demonstrate
                        that they and the prominent star-forming ring are separate structures. The images also show a hole where the
                        rings seem to split into arcs. This hole is where astronomers believe M32 punched through Andromeda's galactic disk.</p>
